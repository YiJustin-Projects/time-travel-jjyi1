I learned how to make a github repo from the terminal (mostly), as well as how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues a github repo may face. Two mistakes I fixed was my files having quotes in themby mistake, as well as almost wiping out my progress on my local machine. The command that saved the day was for sure the clone command, with it, I was able to restore the repository locally from the website.

This repository was created for CSE 464: Software QA and Testing. This is the README file.
The gitignore file includess the log pattern as well as the zip pattern. This is because we don't want log files in the repository, as well as any compressed files, since GIT compresses files with their own methods. 
The author branch will be used for rough, newer ideas, while the editor branch will be used to rewiew set ideas before release.
